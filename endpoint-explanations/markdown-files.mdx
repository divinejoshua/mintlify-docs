## How to Generate Markdown for files

Make a `POST` request to the `/v2/markdown-converter/` endpoint with the required parameters in the body and make sure you use the `file` type.

<Note>
To use the `file` type, the resource can either be provided as URLs or if you are using our SDKs the resource can be the path to the file.
Note: File paths only work with our SDKs if you are calling our API's directly, all files must be provided as URLs. You can consider services like Amazon S3, Cloudinary, or similar platforms to host your files and provide their URLs to the API. 
</Note>


### Request Example (File Path)
<CodeGroup>
 
```python Python
from wetro import Wetrocloud
    
# Initialize the Wetrocloud client
client = Wetrocloud(api_key="your_api_key")
    
# Insert a file into a Collection
insert_response = client.collection.insert_resource(
    collection_id="my_unique_collection_id",
    resource="./essay/paul_graham_essay.pdf", # Replace with your actual file path
    type="file"
)
    
print(insert_response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Wetrocloud from "wetro-sdk";

// Initialize the Wetrocloud client
const client = new Wetrocloud({
  apiKey: "your_api_key"
});

// Insert a file into a Collection
const response = await client.markDownConverter({
  resource: "./essay/paul_graham_essay.pdf", // Replace with your actual file path
  resource_type:
});

console.log("converted to markdown", response);
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.wetrocloud.com/v2/markdown-converter/ \
  --header 'Authorization: Token <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    # File Paths are not accepted via cURL, therefore files must be provided as URL
    "resource": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dxcb59rb3/image/upload/v1746640907/Payverse_Demo_wfhxr9.pdf", 
    "type": "file"
  }'
