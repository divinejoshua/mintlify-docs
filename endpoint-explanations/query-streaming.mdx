## Free Text Response: Streaming

Free text response provides natural, conversational-style answers to your queries. It is ideal for general Q&A and scenarios where a narrative or contextualized explanation is needed. 
Streaming the response gives makes it faster and gives the chatbot effect of the system typing out the answer for you

### Request Example
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from wetro import Wetrocloud

# Initialize the Wetrocloud client
client = Wetrocloud(api_key="your_api_key")

# Query the collection with streaming
streaming_response = client.collection.query_collection(
    collection_id="my_unique_collection_id",
    request_query="What are the sales trends for Q1?",
    stream=True
)

# Process streaming response
for chunk in streaming_response:
    print(chunk.response, end="")
```

```javascript Javascript
import Wetrocloud from "wetro-sdk";

const wetrocloud = new Wetrocloud();

const collectionId = '<collection_id>';
const query = 'What are the sales trends for Q1?';

const response = await wetrocloud.queryResource({
  collection_id: collectionId,
  request_query: query,
  stream: true
});

for await (const item of response) {
    console.log("Received item:", item);
}
```
</CodeGroup>
