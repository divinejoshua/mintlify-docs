description: 'Learn how to query your collections in WetroCloud for both free text and structured responses.'
---
The `query` endpoint allows you to retrieve information from a collection (your resources) via the WetroCloud API.  
This endpoint supports two response formats to suit different use cases:  

- **Free Text Response**: A natural language answer to your query.  
- **Structured Output Response**: A structured JSON output.

Each response type has unique request and response formats, which are explained in detail on their respective pages.  


## Free Text Response

Free text response provides natural, conversational-style answers to your queries. It is ideal for general Q&A and scenarios where a narrative or contextualized explanation is needed. Unlike structured output, free text does not require additional parameters like `json_schema` and `json_schema_rules`.

### Request Example
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from wetro import Wetrocloud

# Initialize the Wetrocloud client
client = Wetrocloud(api_key="your_api_key")

# Query the collection
response = client.collection.query_collection(
    collection_id="my_unique_collection_id",
    request_query="What are the sales trends for Q1?"
)

print(query_response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Wetrocloud from "wetro-sdk";

// Initialize the Wetrocloud client
const client = new Wetrocloud({
  apiKey: "your_api_key"
});

// Query the collection
const response = await client.queryCollection({
  collection_id: "my_unique_collection_id",
  request_query: "What are the sales trends for Q1?",
});

console.log("Query response:", response);
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/collection/query/ \
  --header 'Authorization: Token <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "collection_id": "<collection_id>",
    "request_query": "What are the sales trends for Q1?"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Request Example with Stream
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from wetro import Wetrocloud

# Initialize the Wetrocloud client
client = Wetrocloud(api_key="your_api_key")

# Query the collection with streaming
streaming_response = client.collection.query_collection(
    collection_id="my_unique_collection_id",
    request_query="What are the sales trends for Q1?",
    stream=True
)

# Process streaming response
for chunk in streaming_response:
    print(chunk.response, end="")
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Wetrocloud from "wetro-sdk";

// Initialize the Wetrocloud client
const client = new Wetrocloud({
  apiKey: "your_api_key"
});

// Query with streaming enabled
const response = await client.queryCollection({
  collection_id: "my_unique_collection_id",
  request_query: "What are the sales trends for Q1?",
  stream: true
});

// Process streaming response
for await (const chunk of response) {
  console.log("Received chunk:", chunk.response);
}
```
