description: 'Learn how to query your collections in WetroCloud for both free text and structured responses.'
---
The `query` endpoint allows you to retrieve information from a collection (your resources) via the WetroCloud API.  
This endpoint supports two response formats to suit different use cases:  

- **Free Text Response**: A natural language answer to your query.  
- **Structured Output Response**: A structured JSON output.

Each response type has unique request and response formats, which are explained in detail on their respective pages.  


## Free Text Response

Free text response provides natural, conversational-style answers to your queries. It is ideal for general Q&A and scenarios where a narrative or contextualized explanation is needed. 
This response format supports [streaming](query-streaming)

### Response Example: Free Text

  "response": "The sales for Q1 increased by 20% compared to last year, with online channels contributing significantly.",
  "tokens": 120,
  "success": true

| `success`  | Indicates whether the query was successful.          |

## Structured Output Response
Structured output is a feature that allows large language models (LLMs) to generate responses in a specific format with your resources. Structured output is best for extracting structured data to fit your application's needs. It returns data formatted with the `json_schema` and `json_schema_rules` you provide.
To use the structured output feature you need to provide the following parameters:
