## Structured Output Response
Structured output is a feature that allows large language models (LLMs) to generate responses in a specific format with your resources. Structured output is best for extracting structured data to fit your applicationâ€™s needs. It returns data formatted with the `json_schema` and `json_schema_rules` you provide.
To use the structured output feature you need to provide the following parameters:

| Parameter           | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `collection_id`      | String | The unique ID of the collection to query.                                   |
| `request_query`      | String | The search term or query text.                                              |
| `json_schema`        | String | The desired structure for the JSON response.                                |
| `json_schema_rules`  | String | Custom rules to guide the response's adherence to the specified JSON schema.|

### `json_schema`

The `json_schema` parameter defines the structure of the response you want the system to return. This parameter helps ensure the output matches your application's requirements.

**Example JSON Schema**

```json
{
    "topic" : "string",
    "description" : "string",
    "description" : "int"
}
```

**Example JSON Schema (List)**

If you want a list of items and not just a single item, you can specify the json schema by putting the entire object in a list

```json
[
  {
    "topic" : "string",
    "description" : "string",
    "description" : "int"
  }
]
```

### `json_schema_rules`

The `json_schema_rules` parameter allows you to define custom rules for how the schema is applied. Another way to think about this is that it is a set of instructions for the LLM to follow when generating the response. This can also be in form of a more detailed prompt This can include constraints on the data, additional formatting, or validation logic.
