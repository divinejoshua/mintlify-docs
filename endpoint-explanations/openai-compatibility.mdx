#### Introduction 
We designed Wetrocloud's API to be mostly compatible with OpenAI's client libraries, making it easy to configure your existing applications to run on Wetrocloud and try our inference with 10X speed.
We supports a multiple of models from OpenAI, Anthopic, Meta etc. Visit [Wetrocloud supported models list](/endpoint-explanations/models) to check out our supported models.


#### Configuring OpenAI to Use Wetrocloud API
To start using Wetrocloud with OpenAI's client libraries, ensure you have the OpenAI SDK installed, then pass your Wetrocloud API key to the api_key parameter and change the base_url to https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/openai:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install OpenAI SDK">
    First, install OpenAI.
    
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    pip install openai
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuration">
    To use Wetrocloud with OpenAI’s SDK, set the API base URL to Wetrocloud’s endpoint and provide your API key.
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import openai

    client = openai.OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/openai",
        api_key="<wetrocloud_api_key>"
    )
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Example: Text Completion">
    Just use
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    import openai

    client = openai.OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/openai",
        api_key="<wetrocloud_api_key>"
    )

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.3-70b",
    messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is Wetrocloud?"}
        ]
    )

    print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>
