title: 'Query your Resources'
description: 'Learn how to query your collections in WetroCloud for both free text and structured responses.'
---
The `query` endpoint allows you to retrieve information from a collection (your resources) via the WetroCloud API.  
This endpoint supports two response formats to suit different use cases:  

- **Free Text Response**: A natural language answer to your query.  
- **Structured Output Response**: A structured JSON output.

Each response type has unique request and response formats, which are explained in detail on their respective pages.  


## Free Text Response

Free text response provides natural, conversational-style answers to your queries. It is ideal for general Q&A and scenarios where a narrative or contextualized explanation is needed. Unlike structured output, free text does not require additional parameters like `json_schema` and `json_schema_rules`.

### Request Example: Free Text Response
<RequestExample>
```bash Free Text cURL request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/query/ \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "collection_id": "YOUR_COLLECTION_ID",
    "request_query": "What are the sales trends for Q1?"
  }'
```
```python Free
import requests

url = "https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/query/"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "collection_id": "abc123",
    "request_query": "What are the sales trends for Q1?"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```
</RequestExample>
