## What is a Collection?

A collection in the WetroCloud API acts as a container for resources such as text, files and the other [supported types](/api-reference/supported-resource-types). Every collection is identified by a unique `collection_id`.

## How to Create a Collection

<Note>
Before you begin!<br />
Visit the [Wetrocloud console](https://console.wetrocloud.com/) to get your API key. If you have trouble obtaining it, refer to this [guide](/how-to-access-your-API-Key). 
</Note>

To create a collection, make a `POST` request to the `/v1/collection/` endpoint. This operation is simple, as no body parameters are requiredâ€”only an authorization token in the header.

### Request Example
<CodeGroup>

```cURL cURL
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/collection/ \
--header 'Authorization: Token <api-key>'
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/collection/"
headers = {"Authorization": "Token <api-key>"}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

```javascript Javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = 'https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/collection/';
const headers = { 'Authorization': 'Token <api-key>' };

axios.post(url, {}, { headers })
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
</CodeGroup>
### Successful Response

If the request is valid, the response will include:

- A unique `collection_id` for your new collection.
- A success confirmation.

**Example Response**

```json
{
  "collection_id": "72b52a94-9dba-40eb-8018-dc425d173d00",
  "success": true
}
```
