title: 'Image to text (OCR)'
description: 'Learn how to query images in WetroCloud to retrieve information, descriptions, or answers based on the image using the WetroCloud APIs image-to-text endpoint.'
---
The `image-to-text` endpoint allows you to analyze an image and ask questions about its content via the WetroCloud API.  
This endpoint supports two response formats to suit different use cases:  

- **Free Text Response**: A natural language answer to your query.  
- **Structured Output Response**: A structured JSON output (Coming Soon...).

Each response type has unique request and response formats, which are explained in detail on their respective pages.  


## Free Text Response

Free text response provides natural, conversational-style answers to your queries. It is ideal for general Q&A and scenarios where a narrative or contextualized explanation is needed. Unlike structured output, free text does not require additional parameters like `json_schema` and `json_schema_rules`.

### Request Example
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from wetro import Wetrocloud

# Initialize the Wetrocloud client
client = Wetrocloud(api_key="your_api_key")

# Extract text from an image and answer questions about it
ocr_response = client.image_to_text(
    image_url = "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTQBQcwHfud1w3RN25Wgys6Btt_Y-4mPrD2kg&s",
    request_query="What animal is this?"
)
print(ocr_response)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Wetrocloud from "wetro-sdk";

// Initialize the Wetrocloud client
const client = new Wetrocloud({
  apiKey: "your_api_key"
});

const imageUrl = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTQBQcwHfud1w3RN25Wgys6Btt_Y-4mPrD2kg&s';
const query = 'What animal is this?';

// Extract text from an image and answer questions about it
const response = await client.imageToText({
  image_url: imageUrl,
  request_query: query
});

console.log("Image to text:", response);
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.wetrocloud.com/v1/image-to-text/ \
  --header 'Authorization: Token <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "image_url": "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTQBQcwHfud1w3RN25Wgys6Btt_Y-4mPrD2kg&s",
    "request_query": "What animal is this?"
  }'
```
