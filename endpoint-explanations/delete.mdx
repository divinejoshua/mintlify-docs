title: 'Delete a Collection'
description: 'Learn how to delete a collection using the Wetrocloud API when they are no longer needed.'

Collections in WetroCloud store indexed resources for retrieval and query operations. Deleting a collection can help remove outdated data.

## When to Use the Delete Endpoint

Use the `/v1/delete/` endpoint when:

- A collection has served its purpose and is no longer needed.
- Data in a collection must be  removed.


To delete a collection, send a `DELETE` request to the `/v1/delete/` endpoint with the required parameters in the body.

### Required Parameters

| Parameter      | Type   | Description                           |
|-----------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| `collection_id` | String | The unique ID of the collection to delete. |
