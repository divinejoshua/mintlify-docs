<Note>
Before you begin!<br />
Visit the [Wetrocloud console](https://console.wetrocloud.com/) to get your API key. If you have trouble obtaining it, refer to this [guide](/how-to-access-your-API-Key). 
</Note>

The WetroCloud API provides access to core features for building RAG systems that you can integrate directly into your application. It follows a clean, organized structure around the main resources you'll work with, designed to keep things simple and efficient.

### Sample Requests
We provide sample API calls next to each method, using cURL. Simply replace the placeholders with your specific parameters and test the calls directly from the command line. If you're new to cURL, check out this tutorial on [using cURL with APIs](https://www.baeldung.com/curl-rest).

If you're more comfortable with graphical tools, you can also [use Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) if you aren't familiar with cURL. Postman is a user-friendly platform for developing and testing APIs. You can explore the [Wetrocloud Postman Collection](https://www.wetrocloud.com) to see how our API works.

<Warning>
  Important! <br />Always prefix your API key with `Token ` (including a space). Example: `Token YOUR_API_KEY`. Requests without this format will be rejected.
