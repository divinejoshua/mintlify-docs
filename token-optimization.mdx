### Usage Tier
Token optimization involves refining how input data is represented and processed as tokens by AI models to enhance performance, efficiency, and interpretability. Tokens are the basic units of input, like words, subwords, or characters, which are processed by models such as transformers.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Reducing Token Count:</strong> Concise inputs reduce computation cost and inference time. Techniques like removing redundant information or using abbreviations can help.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Improving Tokenization Schemes:</strong> Choosing an appropriate tokenizer (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding, WordPiece) ensures better representation of rare and common terms, minimizing loss of meaning and improving model accuracy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Context Preservation:</strong> Optimizing token sequence length while retaining contextual integrity ensures that the model comprehends the input without losing critical details.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task-Specific Adjustments:</strong> Tailoring tokenization to a specific application or dataset improves relevance and fine-tuning efficiency.
    </li>
</ul>

  By implementing these strategies, developers can achieve faster processing, lower costs, and improved model performance, especially in resource-constrained or real-time applications.
