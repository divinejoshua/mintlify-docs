<Note>
Before you begin!<br />
Visit the [Wetrocloud console](https://console.wetrocloud.com/) to get your API key. If you have trouble obtaining it, refer to this [Guide](#). 
</Note>


#### Project Setup
If you're already familiar with Python and environment setups, then you could skip this section.

1. Create an `.env` file to store your API key securely.
```
WETROCLOUD_API_KEY="Token wtc-123XXXXXXX" 
```
2. Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory. Add the `.env` file to this list to ensure it is not accidentally shared or committed to version control.This will prevent your sensitive API key from being exposed in public repositories or to others working on the project.
```
.env
```


3. Make sure your environment is set up to load the `.env` file (you‚Äôll use a library like `python-dotenv` for this).
```python
pip install python-dotenv
```

Great job!üéâ Your project is all set up and ready to go‚Äînow it‚Äôs time to write your Python script.
